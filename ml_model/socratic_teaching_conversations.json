Imagine you have two piles of sorted playing cards.  One pile is Ace through 5, and the other is 6 through 10. You want to combine these into a single, sorted pile.  How would you do that, step-by-step?  What do you look at to decide which card goes next in the combined pile?"

In code, we can use indices.  Do you see how this is similar to how we might loop through an array to process each element?

If the element at `index2` is smaller, I add that and increment `index2`.  But what if one pile is shorter than the other?

If one of them is smaller, you add it to the merged array and increase the corresponding index.  What happens when `index1` reaches the end of `arr1`?  Or when `index2` reaches the end of `arr2`?

You'd probably look at the middle book, see if the new book's author comes before or after alphabetically, and then repeat the process with the relevant section.  This is similar to how a binary search tree works!\n\nSo, my question to you is:  How does the binary search tree structure, specifically the way you add and remove elements, allow you to always return the smallest or largest value (depending on your tree's setup) and therefore keep your priority queue sorted?

You've got a good grasp of the basics, understanding comparison and rearrangement, and even the logic behind bubble and selection sort.  That's a great foundation.  You're also recognizing the difficulty in translating the textbook explanations into code, especially with the recursive nature of these algorithms.  It's all about visualizing those steps!\n\nSo, let's think about merge sort.  You understand the idea of breaking down the list, sorting the smaller parts, and then combining them.  Now, imagine you have a huge pile of papers you need to sort alphabetically.  You can't just sort everything at once.  What's the *most* efficient way to break down this huge pile and then put it back together in order?  What happens if a paper is missing or if the paper is not a string (e.g. a picture)?"

And keep doing that until I get back to the original huge pile, but now in alphabetical order.\n\nIf a paper is missing, well, that's a problem!

One person gets to write, and then the other person gets a turn.

It's completely normal to feel a little lost when connecting abstract data structures to real-world applications like file systems.  You've got a good grasp of stacks \u2013 that \"last in, first out\" principle is key.  Arrays, on the other hand, give you random access, meaning you can directly access any element.  The choice between them depends on what operation you need to perform most frequently.\n\nSo, thinking about a file system, imagine a folder.  It's like a container holding files and potentially other folders.  How might a stack be useful in organizing a folder's contents?  Or, how could you use an array or a different data structure to represent the hierarchical structure of folders and files within them?

You mentioned the counter aspect.  Imagine that counter isn't just any counter, but one that can only be incremented or decremented atomically (all at once, without interruption).  This atomicity is crucial.  If it wasn't atomic, other processes could see an inconsistent state and lead to problems.\n\nSo, if we think about the printer example, what would happen if two processes tried to decrement the counter at the same time \u2013 that is, simultaneously request to use the printer?

Updating the table every time you change the list would be very slow.  This is why the lookup table strategy, while giving direct access in one step, is often not used to implement linked list indexing directly.

It's like trying to find a person in a crowded room \u2013 using a unique ID (like a human ID) is much more reliable than using a shared characteristic (like hair color).\n\nNow, let's think about this in terms of something you're already comfortable with \u2013 indexes in a single table.

Let's consider this:  when a client (like your web browser) sends an HTTP request, do you think the server processes it immediately, or is there a way the server might need to organize requests in a specific order?  If so, could a queue or stack be involved in how the server handles those requests?  What would be the advantage or disadvantage of the server using one over the other?"

That FIFO (First In, First Out) principle is crucial for handling requests efficiently.\n\nNow, let's think about *how* the server might use a queue.  Does the order in which requests are processed *always* need to be the same as they arrived?  Maybe the server needs to prioritize requests.

And yes, you're right, a timer mechanism within a queue could indeed reject requests exceeding a time limit.  Multiple queues, each with its own purpose, is a powerful way to manage the different needs of various requests.\n\nNow, think about this: how would you implement a system that handles requests with varying priorities *and* time constraints?

But, the key difference, and where vulnerabilities can arise, is *how* you access and modify the data.  Stacks, by their nature, only allow you to add or remove elements from the top.  Think about how this restricted access might affect things like security.\n\nConsider this: if you were using an array to store sensitive data, could an attacker potentially influence the data, or even the sequence in which it's stored, by manipulating its values?

I'm trying to get my head around how they work, and I'm finding the theory a bit confusing.\n\nI think I understand the basic principles:  it's about using cryptography to ensure authenticity and integrity of data, right?  Like, if you sign a document, nobody can change it without you noticing, and everyone can verify that it was really you who signed it.  But then we get into things like public-key cryptography and hashing... and that's where I'm getting lost"

It's completely understandable that you're finding the theory a bit tricky; it combines a few different concepts.

Think of it like a handwritten signature on a paper document \u2013 it proves the document's origin and prevents unauthorized changes.\n\nNow,  public-key cryptography and hashing are the crucial pieces that make digital signatures work.  You mentioned you understand the *basic* principles.  Can you explain how you would *verify* a handwritten signature on a document? What key elements would you look for, and why are those elements important to determine the signature's authenticity?"

You mentioned comparing the signature to a known sample and checking the document's physical condition.  If we were dealing with a digital signature, how would we identify the equivalent of a known sample signature, or a document's physical condition?  What's the digital equivalent of comparing a signature to a known sample, and what digital characteristic is analogous to the physical condition of the paper document?"

You're essentially checking if the signature was created *using* that known sample.  In a digital signature, the public key does the same.

If the current node's value is greater than the target value, a yellow highlight would be good. If it's less than the target, maybe a light blue.  But what if the values are *equal*?  How can you design the interface so that the user *immediately* understands that they've found the correct node?

That specific restriction is what makes them useful in certain situations, and it often comes into play when you're dealing with tasks that require a specific order of operations, like evaluating expressions.  Arrays, on the other hand, are more flexible, allowing you to access any element directly.  So, the choice between a stack and an array often depends on how you need to access and modify the data.\n\nNow, when you introduce parallel processing, the key thing to think about is how the operations on the data structure can be broken down and performed simultaneously.  For example, if you're using a stack in a serial (single-processor) way, you're essentially doing the operations in a single line.  But in parallel?  Does that"

That's a very good starting point.\n\nIf you imagine a stack of dishes, and two waiters (threads) trying to grab a dish from the top at the same time, what would happen?  One has to wait, right?

Maybe a different kind of stack, one that can handle multiple waiters accessing different parts of the stack, is the way to go.  Like, instead of one top, maybe you have a queue (a line) of dishes, and different threads could access different parts of that queue without conflicting?

Imagine a stack not just as a single pile, but as a series of trays, each holding a specific number of dishes.  Each tray has its own lock.
