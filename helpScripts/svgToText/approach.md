### Approach: Concatenating Model Responses and Writing to a File

#### Objective:
The goal is to read an SVG file, send its content to a local LLaMA model (`hwm:latest`) using the Ollama API, concatenate the partial responses received from the model, and save the final concatenated response to a text file (`response.txt`).

#### Steps:

1. **Read SVG File**:
   - The SVG file (`work.svg`) is read using the `fs.readFile` method, which extracts the file's content as text (`svgData`).

2. **Prepare Request Payload**:
   - A POST request is made to the local Ollama server (`http://localhost:11434/api/generate`) with the model name (`hwm:latest`) and the content of the SVG file as the `prompt`.

3. **Stream the Model's Response**:
   - The model returns responses in a stream format, sending partial chunks of the result incrementally.
   - Each chunk is parsed and concatenated into a `fullResponse` string using the `on('data')` event listener.

4. **Write Concatenated Response to File**:
   - After receiving all chunks, the full concatenated response is saved to a text file (`response.txt`) using `fs.writeFile`.
   - The `on('end')` event listener ensures the file is written only after the entire response is received.

#### Conclusion:
This approach ensures that the SVG content is processed by the model in a streaming fashion, and all partial responses are concatenated and saved in a single text file for further use. This method is efficient and handles the incremental nature of the model's output.

This concise approach allows for handling streamed responses effectively and saving the results for future reference.
